# CrimeScope
CrimeMap helps landlords and anyone seeking a home make safer choices by visualizing neighborhood crime data. Identify high-crime areas, explore safer alternatives, and stay informed about community safety.

**Note:** As of now, CrimeMap focuses exclusively on crime data in Toronto, offering a localized but impactful solution to safety-conscious decision-making.

This project was **built** by _LakTeryny_, _RashidM2006_, and _CoolPersonThatCodes_ for **geesehacks 2025**
